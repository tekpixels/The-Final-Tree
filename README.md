## The Final Tree

i'm too lazy to remove the bottom text

It's a pretty boring game but I have big plans for it

Don't expect me to upgrade this a lot! i actually have a life

that's it

An incremental game engine based on The Prestige Tree. It still requires programming knowledge, but it's mostly pretty easy things and copy/pasting.
